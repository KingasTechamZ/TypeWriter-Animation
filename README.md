# TypeWriter-Animation
Hello Guys, In this repository, I shared how you can create a quick but easy Typewriter Animation using HTML and CSS.
You just have to get an IDE, you can use anything. I have used VS Code (Visual Studio Code).
Then you have to create two files, one is for index.html and main.css. In the 'index.html' file, you can enter the HTML codes and in the 'main.css' file, you can enter the CSS Code.
Just Copy Paste and you are good to go!!! :)

Thanking you,

Have a Good Day!!!
